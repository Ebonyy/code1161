TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Righto, so I found this website Lynda, and ive watched all these tutorials on python, 
specifically Json, and it has helped clear up some aspects for me. However, im still hella confused
kinda wish I could spend more time and fully understand each section before moving on, or maybe
im just a slow learner, idk.
