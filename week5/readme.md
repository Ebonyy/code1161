TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Okay, this week exercise 1 was easier (kind of? not really) but still hella confused, but 
honestly, that shouldnt be a suprise at this stage, im just a ball of confusion. What I do understand
is collecting the different parts of the triangle, e.g the hypotenuse, yet trying to put it into code was
a task all in itself. get_triangle_facts I have no idea what is happen after this bit :(
