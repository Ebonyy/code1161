TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This past week, I have formulated a few questions for mhy data set such as, "Is there any corrolation between an Emperors name, and where they were born," "Which emperor lived the longest?" etc. I have also started to decide iwhich graphs would be best to display my data corrolating to my questions.
