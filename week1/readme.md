In this weeks class I learned about the course structure and outline, along with an introduction into the python neccesities for this course. Github, Anaconda, Visual Studio Code were all downloaded easily from the respective websites, however Git (not to be confused with Github) was a struggle. It required many trial and error test runs before it was able to be configured through VSC. Once up and running, I could complete first Python excercise. The excercise was relatively easy, requiring only the command print then debugging. Oh, and for some reason, my laptops terminal had disappeared?? That was super werid. Then on Github, I "commit to master" and push the completed project. Despite the class being three hours long, most time was spent downloading material and trying to get everyones software working.
