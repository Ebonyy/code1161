TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Ya, so I chose the Roman Emperors from 26BC to 395AD data set as it seemed intersting. Completely different from what I orginally intended. Probably going to compare the lifespans and how each emperor died. Maybe even compare regions they were born and see if there is any corrolation to names, lifespan etc.
